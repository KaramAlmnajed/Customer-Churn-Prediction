# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. It compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, with Logistic Regression emerging as the best performer.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Churn risk segmentation
- Actionable insights for customer retention

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Findings
- Top churn factors: Monthly charges, Internet service type, Phone service
- Churn risk distribution: Low (45.9%), Medium (33.4%), High (20.7%)
- Logistic Regression model achieved 76.4% accuracy and 0.629 F1-score

## Future Improvements
- Explore deep learning models for churn prediction
- Develop a web application for real-time churn prediction
